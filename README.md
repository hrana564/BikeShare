## General Information
- This project aims to understand the factors influencing bike rental counts in a city bike-sharing system and to develop a predictive model.
- Background: With the increasing popularity of bike-sharing systems, it is crucial to understand the demand patterns to optimize resource allocation and improve user satisfaction.
- Business Problem: The project seeks to predict bike rental demand based on various features such as weather conditions, seasonal effects, and temporal factors, aiding in efficient bike distribution and management.
- Dataset: The dataset used is the "day.csv" file from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing daily counts of bike rentals along with weather and seasonal information.

## Conclusions
- **Seasonality Impact**: Certain seasons, such as summer, significantly increase bike rental counts.
- **Weather Conditions**: Clear and favorable weather conditions positively correlate with higher bike rentals.
- **Temporal Trends**: Bike rentals show a rising trend over the years, indicating growing popularity.
- **Feature Importance**: Apparent temperature (atemp), year (yr), and season (season_3) are among the top features influencing bike rental demand.

## Technologies Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
